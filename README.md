 ## Description

 ## Usage

 Application will be started by using the command node index.js then questions will be asked for project title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instruction, license , gitHub username and email. One all questions are answered a readme file will be generated in the project directory using project title as a file name. See simulation video below.
